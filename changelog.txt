Version 1.9.2:
    General:
		Added options to disable input range validation for humidex and heat index.
		Added firmware and host support for a tachometer.
	       
	QTenki: Better error handling (auto-reopen) and related logging options.

Version 1.9.1:
    General:
        - For Humidex and Heat index, when the input temperature/humidity is out of
          range, simply pass the temperature to the output. Better than displaying
          innaccurate and sometimes insane values.
	Command-line:
	    - Use the library to compute virtual channels. (code deduplication)
	QTenki:
	    - Changes to the theme.

Version 1.9.0:
	QTenki: 
		- Merged measurement type and unit together (gives Temperature - C,
		  Humidity - % etc).
		- The last heading line before the actual data is now alias.
		  Should reduce manipulations when importing in spreadsheet software.
		- Added a configuration tab.
		- System gui colors can be overridden. (For a special user who dislikes
		  the win7 default theme (too much white). Instead of changing his 
		  system theme (the sensible thing to do), he insists the application 
		  should change the colors itself. The customer is always right, but
		  at least I made this feature configurable, and off by default.

	Misc:
		- Updated Makefile.mingw in client/ and added conditionals for win32 in
			qtenki/
		- Public library API does not require including usb.h anymore

Version 1.8:
	New QTbased GUI for easy logging
    Added support for:
	  - SE95 I2C Temperature sensor
	  - ADT7410 I2C Temperature sensor
	  - D6F_V03A1 airflow sensor
	Firmware can be configured to use an external reference voltage.

Version 1.7:
	Environment variable USBTENKI_TRACE can be set for debugging.
	Added support for the TSL2561 sensor raw channels and virtual Lux Channel.
