General Description:
USB driver configuration for AVR-Doper
*/

/* ---------------------------- Hardware Config ---------------------------- */

#define USB_CFG_IOPORTNAME      D
/* This is the port where the USB bus is connected. When you configure it to
 * "B", the registers PORTB, PINB and DDRB will be used.
 */
#define USB_CFG_DMINUS_BIT      0
/* This is the bit number in USB_CFG_IOPORT where the USB D- line is connected.
 * This may be any bit in the port.
 */
#define USB_CFG_DPLUS_BIT       2
/* This is the bit number in USB_CFG_IOPORT where the USB D+ line is connected.
 * This may be any bit in the port. Please note that D+ must also be connected
 * to interrupt pin INT0!
 */

/* ----------------------- Optional Hardware Config ------------------------ */

/* #define USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORTNAME   D */
/* If you connect the 1.5k pullup resistor from D- to a port pin instead of
 * V+, you can connect and disconnect the device from firmware by calling
 * the macros usbDeviceConnect() and usbDeviceDisconnect() (see usbdrv.h).
 * This constant defines the port on which the pullup resistor is connected.
 */
/* #define USB_CFG_PULLUP_BIT          4 */
/* This constant defines the bit number in USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORT (defined
 * above) where the 1.5k pullup resistor is connected. See description
 * above for details.
 */
/* #define  USB_BUFFER_SECTION         ".bss" */
/* The USB receive buffer (variable "usbRxBuf") with a length of 22 bytes
 * MUST NOT cross a 256 byte boundary. We have introduced this configuration
 * option to allow you to change the data segment where this buffer is
 * allocated. If you have problems with the default segment (start of .bss),
 * you may change this setting. See the comment in usbdrv.h for details.
 * On IAR C, the default is the TINY_Z segment (first 256 bytes). You must
 * change this default for devices which don't have RAM below 0x100.
 */

/* --------------------------- Functional Range ---------------------------- */

#define USB_CFG_HAVE_INTRIN_ENDPOINT    0
/* Define this to 1 if you want to compile a version with two endpoints: The
 * default control endpoint 0 and an interrupt-in endpoint 1.
 */
#define USB_CFG_HAVE_INTRIN_ENDPOINT3   0
/* Define this to 1 if you want to compile a version with three endpoints: The
 * default control endpoint 0, an interrupt-in endpoint 1 and an interrupt-in
 * endpoint 3. You must also enable endpoint 1 above.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_HALT          0
/* Define this to 1 if you also want to implement the ENDPOINT_HALT feature
 * for endpoint 1 (interrupt endpoint). Although you may not need this feature,
 * it is required by the standard. We have made it a config option because it
 * bloats the code considerably.
 */
#define USB_CFG_INTR_POLL_INTERVAL      10
/* If you compile a version with endpoint 1 (interrupt-in), this is the poll
 * interval. The value is in milliseconds and must not be less than 10 ms for
 * low speed devices.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IS_SELF_POWERED         0
/* Define this to 1 if the device has its own power supply. Set it to 0 if the
 * device is powered from the USB bus.
 */
#define USB_CFG_MAX_BUS_POWER           100
/* Set this variable to the maximum USB bus power consumption of your device.
 * The value is in milliamperes. [It will be divided by two since USB
 * communicates power requirements in units of 2 mA.]
 */
#define USB_CFG_SAMPLE_EXACT            1
/* This variable affects Sampling Jitter for USB receiving. When it is 0, the
 * driver guarantees a sampling window of 1/2 bit. The USB spec requires
 * that the receiver has at most 1/4 bit sampling window. The 1/2 bit window
 * should still work reliably enough because we work at low speed. If you want
 * to meet the spec, set this value to 1. This will unroll a loop which
 * results in bigger code size.
 * If you have problems with long cables, try setting this value to 1.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_FN_WRITE      0
/* Set this to 1 if you want usbFunctionWrite() to be called for control-out
 * transfers. Set it to 0 if you don't need it and want to save a couple of
 * bytes.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_FN_READ       0
/* Set this to 1 if you need to send control replies which are generated
 * "on the fly" when usbFunctionRead() is called. If you only want to send
 * data from a static buffer, set it to 0 and return the data from
 * usbFunctionSetup(). This saves a couple of bytes.
 */
#define USB_CFG_IMPLEMENT_FN_WRITEOUT   0
/* Define this to 1 if you want to use interrupt-out (or bulk out) endpoint 1.
 * You must implement the function usbFunctionWriteOut() which receives all
 * interrupt/bulk data sent to endpoint 1.
 */
#define USB_CFG_HAVE_FLOWCONTROL        0
/* Define this to 1 if you want flowcontrol over USB data. See the definition
 * of the macros usbDisableAllRequests() and usbEnableAllRequests() in
 * usbdrv.h.

#define USB_CFG_VENDOR_NAME     'r','a','p','h','n','e','t','.','n','e','t'
#define USB_CFG_VENDOR_NAME_LEN 11

 * must be given as a list of characters under single quotes. The characters
 * are interpreted as Unicode (UTF-16) entities.
 * If you don't want a vendor name string, undefine these macros.
 * ALWAYS define a vendor name containing your Internet domain name if you use
 * obdev's free shared VID/PID pair. See the file USBID-License.txt for

 * device, set USB_CFG_INTERFACE_CLASS to 0 and USB_CFG_DEVICE_CLASS to 0xff.
 */

/* ------------------- Fine Control over USB Descriptors ------------------- */
/* If you don't want to use the driver's default USB descriptors, you can
 * provide our own. These can be provided as (1) fixed length static data in
 * flash memory, (2) fixed length static data in RAM or (3) dynamically at
 * runtime in the function usbFunctionDescriptor(). See usbdrv.h for more
 * information about this function.
 * Descriptor handling is configured through the descriptor's properties. If
 * no properties are defined or if they are 0, the default descriptor is used.
 * Possible properties are:
 *   + USB_PROP_IS_DYNAMIC: The data for the descriptor should be fetched
 *     at runtime via usbFunctionDescriptor().
 *   + USB_PROP_IS_RAM: The data returned by usbFunctionDescriptor() or found
 *     in static memory is in RAM, not in flash memory.
 *   + USB_PROP_LENGTH(len): If the data is in static memory (RAM or flash),
 *     the driver must know the descriptor's length. The descriptor itself is
 *     found at the address of a well known identifier (see below).
 * List of static descriptor names (must be declared PROGMEM if in flash):
 *   char usbDescriptorDevice[];
 *   char usbDescriptorConfiguration[];
 *   char usbDescriptorHidReport[];
 *   char usbDescriptorString0[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringVendor[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringDevice[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringSerialNumber[];
 * Other descriptors can't be provided statically, they must be provided
 * dynamically at runtime.
 *
 * Descriptor properties are or-ed or added together, e.g.:
 * #define USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_DEVICE   (USB_PROP_IS_RAM | USB_PROP_LENGTH(18))
 *
 * The following descriptors are defined:
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_DEVICE
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_CONFIGURATION
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRINGS
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_0
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_VENDOR
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_PRODUCT
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_SERIAL_NUMBER
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_HID
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_HID_REPORT
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_UNKNOWN (for all descriptors not handled by the driver)
 *
